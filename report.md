# Lab 4 - C - "An LCD Driver"

### Objective

##### Write a driver in C for the MSP430 to be used with the LCD screen.

### Preliminary Design

##### Design API (Application Programming Interface)
###### -Use the code from the example in my header file

##### Turn assembly constructs from Lab 3 into usable C code
###### -The same pins will be used as in Lab 3 (saving a lot of time not figuring that all out again)

##### Implement software delays with C
###### -The __delay_cycles(num_cycles) macro seems like a good place to start for the software delays (same number of cycles as in Lab 3 as well)
