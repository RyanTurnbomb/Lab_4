# Lab 4 - C - "An LCD Driver"

## Objective

### Write a driver in C for the MSP430 to be used with the LCD screen.

## Preliminary Design

### -Design API (Application Programming Interface)
### -Turn assembly constructs from Lab 3 into usable C code
### -Implement software delays with C

#### Use the code from the example in my header file
#### The same pins will be used as in Lab 3 (saving a lot of time not figuring that all out again)
#### The __delay_cycles(num_cycles) macro seems like a good place to start for the software delays
